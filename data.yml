    lure a parent into a false sense of security if the Chrome browser is on the computer.  In
    particular, on Windows 8.1, even with the maximum protection settings that indicate
    a child will only be allowed to access the sites specifically allowed by the parent,
    Google Chrome allows google.com and youtube.com regardless (albeit with safesearch
    enabled but that is far different than the no sites setting a parent might try
    to select).  The editor of this site just tried to use Windows Family Safety to
    prevent his 5 year-old from using the Internet and was appalled to discover the
    child would be able to watch Shakira's half-time show, contrary to the implied
    settings.  Whether Microsoft or Google are to blame is unknown.  Perhaps both.
